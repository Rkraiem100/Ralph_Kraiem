  For the 1st reading response, I had to play a game called The Founder on some website. The game is about you trying to create a monolithic corperation and take over the world. The game had great graphics and simple mechanics however there are a few things that aren't explained well. While the game explains everything, it puts so many popups for the tutorial that I just ended up skipping them. Usually you want to have the tutorial teach the player how to play the game naturally. A great example of this is world 1-1 of the original super mario bros. You start off with an enemy infront that walks towards mario and a few blocks. This is meant to teach the player that you need to jump to avoid the enemy and when you jump, you will hit the block teaching the player that there are items inside the blocks. The game teaches all this without a single line of text through clever design. I wish this game would encorperate some smarter design ideas to better teach the player.

  The game did have a few notable bugs. The first and biggest bug is the enemy AI for the main minigame. The main minigame has the player control 1 or more checker pieces with the objective of claiming spaces on the map. Each checker piece has a certain amount of health before it dies and you can attack your opponents pieces to kill them. The first issue is that the enemy AI often times is very dumb. If both players have 1 health and 1 player attacks the other, then the player who's piece is being attacked dies, otherwise both players lose 1 health. The AI is very dumb and if me and my opponent both have the same amount of health initially and I keep attacking, the opponent will ignore it and not do anything. This is a problem since once both pieces are down to 1 health, the opponent has the advantage and can take out the players piece however they never do even though that would be the optimal move. The 2nd bug I found was a bug that caused my game to softcrash. I don't know what happened but during 1 of the minigames, the game completely froze and refused to continue. This only happened once but because I haven't saved in 2 hours, I just ended up quitting.
